# Customer Segmentation with Clustering

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers from a real-world e-commerce dataset across 47 countries. It aims to derive actionable insights for marketing optimisation and customer engagement.

## 📊 Objective
Group customers into meaningful segments based on behavioural and transactional features to guide targeted marketing strategies.

## 🔧 Key Techniques Used
- Feature engineering (Recency, Frequency, CLV, Avg. Unit Cost, Age)
- Outlier detection (IQR method)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction (t-SNE)
- Silhouette score & Elbow method for optimal k
- Data visualisation (Boxplots, Dendrograms, Projections)

## 🧠 Insights
- Identified 5 interpretable customer clusters (e.g. Loyal High-Value, Infrequent High-Spender, Dormant)
- Found 2.9% high-value outlier customers worth retaining as a separate segment
- Visualised clear separation using t-SNE, with PCA confirming variance distribution
